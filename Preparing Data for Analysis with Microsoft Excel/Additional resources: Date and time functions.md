Date and time entries are important in spreadsheets for both planning and analysis. You have practiced creating formulas using dates and have explored some of the more common date and time functions.

### Standard calculations
If you need to revise how to use dates in standard calculations, the 
[Add or Subtract Dates](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-subtract-dates-b83768f5-f695-4311-98b1-757345f7e926)
 page on the Microsoft Support site provides useful examples. If you are working with time entries rather than dates, then the 
[Add or Subtract time](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/add-or-subtract-time-16aa6697-6d6e-49c1-8e2c-3398a7cad6ad)
 page steps through how to work with time entries in standard formulas.

Another page on the Microsoft site called 
Calculate the difference between two times
 provides more detail on combining functions and formatting to generate time results in a customized format.

### Date and time functions
Microsoft Excel has a wide range of date and time functions. The 
[Date and time functions (reference)](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/date-and-time-functions-reference-fd1b5961-c1ae-4677-be58-074152f97b81)
 page provides a comprehensive list of available functions. 

### DATEDIF function
As previously explained, DATEDIF is a legacy function that still works in Excel spreadsheets but no longer has full support. There are no help messages produced if you begin to type a formula containing this function, and itâ€™s not available in the Insert Function wizard. 

If you need to use this function, or you are working on a spreadsheet that already contains it, then the page 
[DATEDIF function](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/datedif-function-25dba1a4-2812-480b-84dd-8b32a451b35c)
is a useful resource. It provides examples of formulas that contain the function and provides a workaround example for the known issue of the MD argument generating an inaccurate result.
