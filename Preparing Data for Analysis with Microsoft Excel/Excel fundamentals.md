**Question 1**
True or False: When you select the Filter button on the Data ribbon, Excel automatically filters the data based on choices that you have already made in the drop-down menus next to each heading. 


- [ ] True



- [X] False


> [!NOTE]
Thatâ€™s correct! Selecting the Filter button on the Data ribbon does not apply a filter. It simply switches the feature on or off. If the filter button is selected to turn on the Filter feature, you would then need to make choices in the drop-down menu to apply a filter to the data.
