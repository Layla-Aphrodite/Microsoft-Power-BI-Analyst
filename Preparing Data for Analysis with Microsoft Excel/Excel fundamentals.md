True or False: When you select the Filter button on the Data ribbon, Excel automatically filters the data based on choices that you have already made in the drop-down menus next to each heading. 


- [ ] True



- [X] False


> [!NOTE]
That’s correct! Selecting the Filter button on the Data ribbon does not apply a filter. It simply switches the feature on or off. If the filter button is selected to turn on the Filter feature, you would then need to make choices in the drop-down menu to apply a filter to the data.


**Question 2**
You want to identify all rows in the data that have a figure exceeding 500 in a specific column. Which of the following options can you use to complete this task?




- [X] Use Greater than on the Number Filter sub-menu.
- [ ] Use Equals on the Number Filter sub-menu.




- [ ] Use Does not equal on the Number Filter sub-menu.


> [!NOTE]
That’s correct! Microsoft Excel is automatically aware of the type of content in the column. This column contains numeric entries and, as a result the drop-down menu automatically contains a Number Filters option which gives access to additional choices, one of which is “greater than”. This filter will look for any number greater than 500. 



**Question 3**
True or False: You need to sort a staff spreadsheet alphabetically by department, and then sort each department by join date with the most recent appearing first. You can complete this task by first using the Sort A-Z shortcut on the Department Name column and then the Sort Newest to Oldest shortcut on the Join Date column.


- [X]True

**Question 4**
You want to create a new name for a cell, but you are not sure if a colleague has already assigned names to the cells. How would you check what names are already in use across the whole workbook?


Select the drop-down arrow on the right of the Name box in the top left of the Excel work area.



Select each worksheet separately and then click on the drop-down arrow on the right of the Name box in the top left of the Excel work area.



Select the Name Manager choice on the Home ribbon.


Correct
That’s correct! Names of assigned cells are visible from anywhere in the workbook. So, if you select this drop-down symbol in any worksheet, it will provide a full list of names in use.

Question 5
You have frozen the top row (Row 1) of the screen to make your spreadsheet easier to read. What cell will your cursor move to when you move to the top of the worksheet using the Control + Home shortcut?


A2



A3



A1


Correct
That’s correct! The keyboard combination Control + Home would normally move the cursor to the first cell in the worksheet, which is A1. However, if the first row contains headings and has been frozen to remain visible onscreen, then the cursor will move to cell A2.

Question 6
What appears on the Formula bar when you enter a calculation in a worksheet cell?


The result.



The calculation.



The calculation and the result.


Correct
That’s correct! When you create a calculation, the result will appear in the cell in the worksheet. The formula (the “engine” that is driving the result) will appear in the Formula Bar. The Formula Bar always shows the real contents of the cell.

Question 7
In larger worksheets, it can be useful to hide columns that are not required. This allows you to scroll through the content more quickly. How does Excel indicate on screen that there are columns hidden in a worksheet? Select all that apply.


Some column initials are shaded in a different background color.



There are two vertical lines or a darker vertical line between two of the column initials.


Correct
That's correct. In Excel for windows, the location of any hidden columns is indicated with two vertical lines between two column initials. In Excel on a mac, it will display a darker vertical line between two column initials.


There is a gap in the sequence of initial letters at the top of the screen.


Correct
That’s correct! Excel will always maintain the full alphabet sequence for the column initials at the top of the Excel screen. If any columns are hidden, there will be a break in this sequence.

Question 8
You type a supplier name into cell C2 in your spreadsheet. You want to use one of Excel’s quick entry features to copy the same supplier name into all cells down to C100. What shape should the mouse pointer be?


An arrow.



A narrow black cross.



A white cross.


Correct
That’s correct! This feature is called Autofill. The mouse pointer must appear as a narrow black cross. It will appear as such if the mouse is resting on the bottom left corner of the cursor. You can then hold down the mouse and drag down to copy the original entry.

Delete drop-down.

Format drop-down.


Correct
That’s correct! The options to hide rows and columns are formatting choices, so they are contained in the Format drop menu.

Question 10
You manually adjust the width of column A and then type 958697100T into cell A2. However, the entry still displays across cell B2, which is currently empty. What is the visual effect on the entry in cell A2 when you enter data into cell B2?


The content will only be partially displayed and some of the entry will be hidden by the content in B2.



The content will be replaced by crosshatch symbols as the column is too narrow to display it fully.



The content will automatically “wrap around” so that some of the heading will be brought down to a new line.


Correct
That’s correct! The entry is primarily numeric but there is a single alphabet character at the end. If an entry is a mixture of letters and numbers, Excel will automatically consider it to be text. If the column is too narrow to display a text entry fully, and the cell to the right contains content, Excel will hide part of the entry.
